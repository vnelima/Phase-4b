# Recommendation Systems - Introduction

## Introduction
In this section, you'll learn about machine learning algorithms that we encounter every day in our lives:  recommendation systems! 

## Recommendation Systems

In this section you'll learn about recommendation system modeling approaches and implementations.

A recommendation system allows predicting the future preference list for a certain customer or user, and recommends the top preference for this user. Examples include: which books would a customer prefer to buy on Amazon, which Netflix movie or series would a user watch next, etc. You'll learn about several different types of recommendation system algorithms and how they work.

## Matrix Factorization

Under the hood, many recommendation system algorithms use matrix factorization. This can be accomplished using techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS), which you'll learn about in this section.

## Implementing Recommender Systems with `surprise` 

`surprise` is a library that is optimized to efficiently create recommendations. You'll get a chance to use this library to code up different implementations of collaborative filtering recommendation systems.

## Summary

In this section, you'll learn the basics of recommendation systems and how to implement them in `surprise`!
