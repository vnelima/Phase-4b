    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- **Improvement with Scaling**: Scaling the data (e.g., standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance) can help clustering algorithms perform better by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.\n",
    "- **Improvement with PCA**: PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important variance, which can help in highlighting the underlying structure and improving clustering performance.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- **Best Performance**: The PCA-transformed data resulted in the best clustering performance with an ARI of 0.0459127111971715.\n",
    "- **Effect of PCA**: PCA positively affected the clustering performance by reducing noise and redundancy in the data, leading to better-defined clusters.\n"
