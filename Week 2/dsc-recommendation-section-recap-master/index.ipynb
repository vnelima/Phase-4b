Matrix factorization or decomposition can help us solve this problem by determining what the overall \"topics\" are when a matrix is factored\n", "* Matrix decomposition can be reformulated as an optimization problem with loss functions and constraints\n", "* Matrix decomposition can be done using either Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS)\n", "* The `surprise` library allows you to build models for CF"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python (learn-env)", "language": "python", "name": "learn-env"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.8.5"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
